# Benchmark summary — run `dev-04`

Git `b2605e2974` (uncommitted changes) · split `hyu: dev`, `hyu: dev` · smoke: False · machine: arm64, 16 GB · Ollama 0.40.15

Task status: COMPLETED: 3

All numbers below were computed from the saved per-query results. N/A = not measurable (missing labels, not run, or undefined).

## Controlled fixture (5 synthetic HYU documents; author-written labels — not a benchmark)

| experiment | status | cases | candidate_cutoff | target_hit_rate | ineligible_returned_rate | starved_rate | empty_rate | returned_units_mean |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R0_DENSE | NOT_RUN | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| R9_PREFILTERING | NOT_RUN | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| R10_POSTFILTERING | NOT_RUN | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

_No results._

## Limitations

- BEIR measures document ranking. No answer-quality metric is reported without annotated cases.
- Protocol B maps chunk rankings to documents by first appearance; it is not the BEIR leaderboard setting.
- LLM-based methods (R6, R7, R8, R13, R14) ran on a subset of queries; compare them with B0 on the same subset (paired columns).
- One auxiliary LLM was used for all LLM-based retrieval methods; results may differ with another model.
- No hyperparameter was tuned on the test splits: every value is the preset default declared before running.
- Gate and filter results come from a small author-written fixture, not from independent labels.

Per-slice rows: `hyu_dev_slices.csv`. Pre-registered comparisons (paired bootstrap 95% CI, permutation p, Holm):

- A0_AAES vs R15_SELF_QUERY: NOT_RUN: R15_SELF_QUERY has no results
- A0_AAES vs A4_QUESTION_ONLY_AMBIGUITY: action macro-F1: NOT_RUN: A4_QUESTION_ONLY_AMBIGUITY has no results
